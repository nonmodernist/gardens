i have the idea for a really cool teaching wiki that collects all kinds of information and i cannot find a tool that i actually want to build it in. 

i tried sphinx: love the out of box features, but the python of it all is far too much work to just post random updates. complicated workflow, pieces of it are hidden from view, and i can't customize it to the degree that i want. 

i tried obsidian-digital-garden, which i use to publish [[garden/Welcome to the Garden\|this site]]. i can't get it to work with gh pages (this is undoubtedly a me problem), and the out of box deployment option (vercel) means the wiki would have to live at a different web address. maybe that's not a big deal but it feels frustrating to me. 

another possible option, one im not sure i can get working, is to use obsidian to write wiki posts with the proper zola or hugo front matter and then use zola or hugo to build the site. that's an idea worth iterating on, i think.
