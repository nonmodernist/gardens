### Why a "digital garden"?
When I was a young teen, I was really interested in neopagan worldviews like Wicca. (Yes, I watched *The Craft* a lot in this era.) This was pre-social media, pre-Web 2.0, even pre-blogging. My mom worked for a major telecom company, so we had free internet, and I loved to spend hours navigating the web as it existed then, researching neopaganism and marveling at the various ways that the web creators of the era used [[garden/metaphors\|metaphors]] to help users navigate their sites. There was a poetry and a freedom to user interface design—rather than using "the blog" as their organizing strategy, these creators built [[labyrinths\|labyrinths]] and [[garden/villages\|villages]] and, yes, [[gardens\|gardens]] of deeply interlinked evergreen content. I lost interest in neopaganism after a while, but I've never lost my fondness for that time on the web. 

I miss when we treated more websites a little like text adventure games, when [[garden/When we went to see the solar eclipse\|discovery]] was part of the joy of using the internet, when designers and creators didn't default to what everyone else did but embraced experimentation. In this space, I want to bring that feeling back, at least for myself if not for others. 

### Who gardens here?
Hi, I'm [Alex](http://nonmodernist.com). I [teach literature and film](https://nonmodernist.com/docs/courses/) in a college English department. I research and write about women who were involved in the film industry in the early 20th century. In addition to this stuff, I'm interested in [[ecology\|ecology]], [[anarchism\|anarchism]], and [[abolition\|abolition]]—and how thinking about these topics can help us reshape digital technologies.
