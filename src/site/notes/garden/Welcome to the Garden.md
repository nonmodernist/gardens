### Who gardens here?
Hi, I'm [Alex](http://nonmodernist.com). I [teach literature and film](https://nonmodernist.com/docs/courses/) in a college English department. I research and write about women who were involved in the film industry in the early 20th century. In addition to this stuff, I'm interested in [[ecology\|ecology]], [[anarchism\|anarchism]], and [[abolition\|abolition]]â€”and how thinking about these topics can help us reshape digital technologies.
