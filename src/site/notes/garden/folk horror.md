**Folk horror**Â is a subgenre ofÂ horror film andÂ horror fictionÂ that uses elements ofÂ folklore to invoke fear and foreboding.

## Folk horror chain
Adam Scovell's "folk horror chain" is a narrative theory that presents "a linking set of narrative traits that have causational and interlinking consequences." The four elements of the folk horror chain are:

1. Landscape
2. Isolation
3. Skewed morals or beliefs
4. The summoning or the happening
